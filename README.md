Objectives for Assignment:

Show sub-menus when the mouse hovers over the color or size menu options.
Rotate t-shirt to see front and back images.
Add animations/transitions without using any JavaScript!
The t-shirt items should collapse to one column on sufficiently small screens.
In other words, the site is usable on any size screen and does not scroll left-to-right on smaller screens.
Use Font Awesome for the icons in the bottom menu
You can include this CSS stylesheet for those icons: https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.3/css/font-awesome.min.css
Use these images for the shirts: shirts.zip (501 KB)
How to Submit
Create a NEW repository on GitHub
Clone that repository to your local machine
Be sure to commit FREQUENTLY - I want to see MANY commits on a REGULAR basis
When you're done (or at regular intervals), make sure you pushed your commits to GitHub
Finally, submit your GitHub repository URL to the assignment on TIYO
AN EXTRA BIT

Additionally, you could deploy your site on Github pages, and add a README.md file to the repo which contains a link to the Github pages site.

EPIC Mode

Add the shirt rotation interaction
You could do this with a hover interaction on the top-right icon in the design
Alternately, you can use JavaScript for this and make the interaction happen on a click
